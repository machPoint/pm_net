## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 2.1 Current State Pain Points

**For Systems Engineers:**
- Manual requirements traceability matrix updates take hours per change
- Impact analysis relies on institutional knowledge and hope
- Missed dependencies cause costly downstream rework
- Requirements documents become stale immediately after CCB approval
- Traceability is bureaucratic overhead, not value-add

**For Program Managers:**
- Requirements changes trigger planning chaos
- Difficult to estimate true cost/schedule impact of changes
- Ripple effects emerge late in development cycle
- Change Control Board meetings lack data-driven impact analysis

**For Engineering Teams:**
- Rework from missed requirement dependencies
- Uncertainty about which designs/tests/analyses need updates
- Time wasted chasing down "what changed and why"
- Requirements churn disrupts focused engineering work

### 2.2 Quantified Impact (Aerospace Industry)
- Requirements changes account for 30-50% of development rework
- Manual traceability consumes 15-25% of SE time
- Missed dependencies caught late cost 10-100x more to fix
- Change impact analysis takes 4-8 hours per significant change

### 2.3 Why This Problem Exists
- Requirements databases aren't designed for change management
- Manual traceability doesn't scale with system complexity
- Human cognitive limits on tracking dependencies
- Tribal knowledge concentrated in senior engineers
- Tools focus on storage, not analysis

## 3. SOLUTION OVERVIEW

### 3.1 Core Concept
DeltaReq uses AI to automatically:
1. Analyze proposed requirements changes
2. Map all affected requirements, designs, tests, and documents
3. Predict downstream impacts (technical, schedule, cost)
4. Generate traceability documentation automatically
5. Provide confidence scoring on impact predictions

### 3.2 Key Differentiators
- **AI-native**: Built for intelligence, not just storage
- **Proactive**: Predicts impacts before changes are approved
- **Automated traceability**: Eliminates manual matrix maintenance
- **Natural language interface**: Engineers describe changes conversationally
- **Aerospace-aware**: Understands safety-critical implications

### 3.3 Value Proposition

**For Systems Engineers:**
"Analyze a requirements change and its full system impact in 30 seconds instead of 3 hours, with AI-generated traceability documentation."

**For Program Managers:**
"Make data-driven Change Control Board decisions with confidence, knowing all downstream impacts before approving changes."

**For Paragon Leadership:**
"Eliminate 60-80% of manual requirements management overhead while reducing costly late-stage rework."

  - Conditions (operational modes, environments)
- Example: "The cabin pressure regulator **shall maintain** 8.2 psi ± 0.3 psi during nominal operations"
  - Subject: cabin pressure regulator
  - Verb: shall maintain
  - Object: pressure (8.2 psi)
  - Condition: nominal operations

- System hierarchy (subsystem relationships)

**Output**:
- Probability that Requirement B is impacted by change to Requirement A
- Confidence score (0-100%)

**Training Approach**:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Historical change data (if available)
   - Input: Changed requirement + candidate downstream requirement

- Historical similar changes (if available)

**Outputs**:
- Schedule impact estimate (days/weeks)
- Cost impact estimate ($K)
- Technical risk score (low/med/high)
- Overall impact score (1-10)

**Method**: Regression models trained on historical data, with fallback heuristics

## 12. TECHNICAL RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### 12.1 AI Accuracy Risk
**Risk**: AI predictions are inaccurate, causing engineers to lose trust

**Mitigations**:
- Start with high confidence threshold (only show 80%+ confidence predictions)
- Always show confidence scores prominently
- Allow users to provide feedback (improve over time)
- Human-in-the-loop: Engineer reviews all predictions before acting
- Conservative bias: Flag possible impacts even if uncertain (false positives better than false negatives for safety)

### 12.2 Data Quality Risk
**Risk**: Paragon's requirements data is inconsistent/incomplete, AI can't learn

**Mitigations**:
- Start with cleanest dataset available (e.g., HALO program)
- Data cleaning phase before AI training
- Graceful degradation (work with imperfect data)
- Manual traceability fallback if AI uncertain

### 12.3 Integration Risk
**Risk**: Can't integrate with Paragon's existing requirements tools (DOORS, Jama)

**Mitigations**:
- Phase 1: Manual export/import (CSV) - MVP doesn't require integration
- Phase 2: One-way sync (import from DOORS)
- Phase 3: Two-way sync if needed
- API-based integration where possible

### 12.4 ITAR/Security Risk
**Risk**: Requirements data is export-controlled, can't use external AI APIs

**Mitigations**:
- On-premises deployment option
- Sanitize requirements text before sending to AI (remove specific technical details)
- Use local LLM models (e.g., Llama 2) instead of API
- Get ITAR review before deployment

### 12.5 User Adoption Risk
**Risk**: Engineers resist using AI tool, prefer manual methods

**Mitigations**:
- Start with volunteers (early adopters)
- Demonstrate clear time savings (80%+ reduction)
- Don't force usage initially (opt-in pilot)
- Address concerns transparently
- Celebrate successes publicly

---

## 15. PARAGON-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### 15.1 Initial Target Programs
**Recommended Start**: HALO ECLSS (Best fit)
- Well-defined requirements baseline
- Active program with ongoing changes
- Medium complexity (not too simple, not overwhelming)
- Safety-critical (high value if AI reduces risk)

**Alternative**: Starlab AUP
- Smaller scope, faster validation
- Newer program, may have cleaner requirements

**Avoid for MVP**: xEVAS
- Too large and complex for initial demo
- Requirements may still be in flux

### 15.2 Stakeholder Alignment
**Critical Champions**:
- VP of Engineering (must approve pilot)
- Lead Systems Engineer on target program (primary user)
- Program Manager (sees value in schedule/cost impact)

**Potential Skeptics**:
- Senior engineers with tribal knowledge ("AI can't replace my expertise")
- IT (integration concerns)
- Quality (compliance with AS9100)

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Demo to VP of Engineering first (get technical buy-in)
- Co-design pilot with lead SE (they're a partner, not a subject)
- Present to Chief Engineer early (leverage their influence)

### 15.3 Compliance Considerations
**AS9100 Requirements Management**:
- Traceability must be auditable (AI must explain reasoning)
- Human approval required for all changes (AI is decision support, not decision maker)
- Document retention (save all AI analysis results)
- Configuration management (baseline requirements versions)

**Human-Rating Requirements**:
- Safety-critical changes require extra scrutiny
- AI can flag safety impacts but not approve them
- Chief Engineer must review AI analysis for safety-critical changes

## 16. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY (Internal)

### 16.1 Positioning for C-Suite Presentation
**Narrative Arc**:
1. **Problem**: Requirements changes cause 30-50% of development rework, waste hundreds of engineering hours
2. **Current State**: Manual traceability, tribal knowledge, hope-based impact analysis
3. **Solution**: AI that predicts impacts in seconds, not hours
4. **Proof**: Demo on realistic Paragon example (e.g., HALO cabin pressure change)
5. **Value**: 80% time savings, reduced rework, better CCB decisions
6. **Risk**: Mitigated (human-in-the-loop, pilot approach)
7. **Investment**: Low (leverage core_se code, Hetzner infrastructure)
8. **Timeline**: Demo ready (now), Pilot in Q2, Production in Q3/Q4
9. **Strategic**: Positions Paragon as AI leader, competitive advantage

**Key Messages**:
- "Transform requirements management from bureaucratic overhead to strategic advantage"
- "Eliminate 80% of manual traceability work while improving quality"
